<h1>Names</h1>
<p>Names serve purpose of holding text associated with a keyword that you can use during the adventure. Those can hold names of characters, places, items or anything else that may not even be a name since you can put any text into the Name.</p>
<p>Big advantage of Names is that you can modify them during the adventure through Story Results. This way, you can have parts of your story text change in response to player choices.</p>
<p>As opposed to Records, names are never displayed to the player unless you deliberately insert them into page title or story text. They can also be inserted in Choice text.</p>
<h2>Editing Names</h2>
<p>Adding a Name should be self explanatory through button label.</p>

<p>You can change Name's keyword and default text using the gear button next to the name. Bin button in turn, will remove a Name from adventure.</p>

<p>Changing Name's keyword will also update all of its occurances within the adventure so you don't have to hunt for any when you decide to do so.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if a Name's keyword is used anywhere in the adventure, you won't be able to remove it until you remove all keyword occurances. This is so you won't accidentally break your story by deleting used keywords.</p>
