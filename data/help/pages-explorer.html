<h1>Page Explorer</h1>
<p>Here you can add, remove, rename and edit individual pages of the adventure. Simply clicking on the element in the list will open the page for editing</p>
<h1>Adding Pages</h1>
<p>To add a new page, simply click the + button. You will be prompted to enter a name for the page. You can enter any name, and it will be automatically set as title of that page, which you can change afterwards if you wish.</p>
<p>Entered name will also be used for naming the file in which page's data will be stored, with an exception that it will be transformed to better support various operating systems the game supports. That means, the actual file name will always be all lower case and will have whitespaces replaced with dashes.</p>
<p>The list will display the names of the pages according to file name, it is also what links between pages will use. This way, you can freely edit all contents of the page without needing to pay attention to needing additional information to make everything work.</p>
<p>A good idea is to use the file names to group parts of your adventure together so they are close to each other in the list. For example, all pages related to the part in a forest could start with name forest, like this: forest-entering, forest-tracking, forest-encounter, and so on.</p>
<p>Another advantage of using file names like this, is if you ever need to edit any of the pages manually, you can easily find which one contains what part of the adventure.</p>
<h1>Editing Pages</h1>
<p>Underneat the Page list view, you will find buttons with gear and bin icons. You can use the bin button to remove pages you don't want in your adventure. However, if you want to remove a page that another page links to, you will need to first unlink the pages before you will be allowed to remove a page</p>
<p>Gear icon on the other hand allows you to rename the page. This will change the file name of the page, in accordance to the rules stated above.</p>
<h1>Starting Page</h1>
<p>Each adventure needs to have a starting page. Meaning the page that is shown first when the player starts the adventure. That page is marked with a star next to its name in the Page Explorer. To mark a page as starting page, first open it by clicking on its name in the list view, and then click on the button with the star.</p>
<h1>Saving the Adventure</h1>
<p>Above the page explorer you will find Save button. When you click it, the program will create pages for the Adventure on your drive, replacing existing pages if any, with those in the editor. It will also remove any pages that are no longer used by the adventure. Unless you click this button, the Adventure will not be saved, so make sure to press it before you exit the editor if you intend to save your work.</p>
