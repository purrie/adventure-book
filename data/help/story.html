<h1>Adventure Story Page</h1>
<p>Story pages are what makes up the adventure itself. Each is presented to the player individually alongside with the choices associated with it.</p>
<p>A Page consists of a title, which can act as a summary for it, or it can be left empty.</p>
<p>The main part of the page takes up the story text which contains description of the scene, what is happening, what's around the player, or it can describe other characters present alongside with what they say or do. Most importantly tho, pages should contain some sort of pivot point in the adventure to which player has to respond. Some sort of conflict or a decision.</p>

<h2>Records and Names</h2>
<p>Below the text editors you will find Record and Name editors in which you can see list of available records and names. Details of what they can be used for and how to manipulate them you will find in relevant pages.</p>
<p>In Story Pages, you can drag and drop a Record or a Name onto either title or story text and a keyword will be created for them. When the page is displayed, the keyword will be evaluated into its current value as of the time of displaying the Page. Which means, you can use them to dynamically enter text or values into Page text depending on how the value of a Record or a Name is changed during the adventure.</p>
