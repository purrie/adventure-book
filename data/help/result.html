<h1>Story Results</h1>
<p>Those serve purpose of linking different Story Pages together. When a Story Result is triggered, either through a Choice or a Test, it will lead the story to a new Page, displaying it to the player.</p>
<p>Aside from linking Pages together, Results also can have modifiers associated to them. Those serve purpose of modifying Records or Names should the Story Result be triggered.</p>
<h1>Editing Results</h1>
<p>Adding a new Result is done through + button. You can name the Result anything you like but it should be short and descriptive as that name will be shown in a drop down menu in Choices editor. Keeping it descriptive will let you better associate where the Result will lead.</p>
<p>Removal is done through the bin button. The editor will warn you if you're trying to remove a Result that is in use.</p>
<p>Gear button is used to rename Results. The name will automatically be updated in Choices that use it.</p>
<p>After you have a Result selected, you can choose which page it leads to from the drop down menu.</p>
<h1>Side Effects</h1>
<p>You can use Add Record and Add Name buttons to add side effects to currently selected Result that will modify selected Record or Name when the Result is triggered.</p>
<p>Records, as described in the Record help page, serve purpose of holding numbers. When you add a Record to modifications, you can put any expression to it, and it will be evaluated at the time of choosing the Result into a number, which will be added to the Record (or removed if it evaluates into a negative number)</p>
<p>Names on the other hand will have their value replaced by whatever you put into the field. Only other Names or Records will be evaluated into their values before the text is assigned to the Name.</p>
