<h1>Records</h1>
<p>Records serve purpose of tracking a value associated with a keyword throughout the adventure. You can use them to track anything that can be represented in an integer. (Only whole numbers are supported) Whatever it is a player strength, health points, progress in a quest or coins gathered.</p>
<p>Big advantage of using Records is that those can be easily changed in accordance to player choice and can be used to modify Tests and Conditions to better support branching paths within the narrative.</p>
<h1>Categories</h1>
<p>Each Record can have a category associated with it. This way, you can group similar Records together in game UI.</p>
<p>All Records are displayed to the player during the game. This way the player can keep track of their progress. However, if you wish to hide a specific record, you can assign it to a 'hidden' category (without the quotation marsk). This way, you can choose which to display to the player and which are only for tracking the adventure.</p>
<h2>Editing Records</h2>
<p>Adding a Record should be self explanatory through the button label</p>
<p>You can also edit all the elements associated with the record by clicking the gear button. This way you can change default value, category or even a keyword of a record. If you decide to change the keyword, all existing keywords within the adventure will be updated to the new one with no need to hunt them manually.</p>
<p>Deleting the Record is done through the bin icon. Keep in mind that you can only delete unused Records. If there's at least one occurance in the story, you won't be able to remove it. This way, you can't accidentally break your adventure.</p>
