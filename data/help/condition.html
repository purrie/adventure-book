<h1>Conditions</h1>
<p>Conditions give you ability to guard a Choice behind a set of conditions. You can use those to guide where the player can lead the story based on some set or rules or story Records.</p>
<p>When a Story Page is presented to the player, all Choices that have Conditions assigned to them will have those conditions evaluated and based on whatever the equasion results in truth or not, a Choice will be available to the player.</p>
<h1>Editing Conditions</h1>
<p>You can add a new Condition using the + button. Bin button removes a condition. However, if a Condition is in use by a Choice, you won't be able to remove a Condition until you unassign it. The gear button allows you to rename a Condition. Condition's name will be updated in the Choices that use it.</p>
<p>When you select a condition, you will be able to write an equasion for it. Each side will be evaluated and then compared to each other to get truth or false value from it.</p>
