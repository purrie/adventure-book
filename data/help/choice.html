<h1>Choices</h1>
<p>Each page needs to have at least one choice for player to choose from. Those choices will be listed in the list view and you can edit their elements when you select one.</p>
<p>To add a Choice, you can click a + button, the bin button removes selected choice. Added choices will be listed by their index in the list view.</p>
<p>After selecting the choice, you can edit its text that will be shown to the player. You can also put Names or Records into the text, by drag and dropping appropriate Name or Record onto the text field.</p>
<h1>Story Results and Tests</h1>
<p>Each choice can have a Story Result associated with it. This way, you can customize where each choice leads and what consequences it carries with it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can assign a Test to the choice. This way, you can create branching paths that can lead to different Story Results depending on some conditions that you assign to the Test</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you assign a Test to a Choice, then you will not be able to assign a Story Result, and vice versa, as it wouldn't make sense.</p>
<h1>Conditions</h1>
<p>Each choice can have a Condition assigned to it. This lets you control which choices are available to the player based on conditions you decide on.</p>
<p>Currently, all choices are displayed to the player, even if they are unavailable. However, reasons for why are not. This may change in the future.</p>
<h1>Game Over</h1>
<p>A Choice can also be assigned to work as an end point to the story. This way, when a player chooses that choice, the story will end and the player will be taken back to the adventure selection menu.</p>
<p>It is suggested to only assign game over to a choice in pages containing an epilogue for the story, signaling to the player that the adventure has ended and possibly describing any conotations associated with it.</p>
