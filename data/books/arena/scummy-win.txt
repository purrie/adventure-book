story: You've tried all the tricks you could, yet the opponent is just stronger, and after a long fight, it's clear you won't be able to win without cheating a little. You grab some sand into your hand and throw it into opponent's face, swinging your weapon right after. The sand manages to distract your opponent long enough to get a couple good hits in to turn the advantage to your side and within a couple minutes, your opponent is down on the ground, defeated.
