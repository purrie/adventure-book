title: Enchanting Armor
story: You notice that in the corner of the room, there's a small blacksmithing workshop with a fireplace, anvil and tools you could use to fix your armor. You decide that facing the dragon without appropriate defence would be a suicide and get to work. You take your armor out of your pack and start heating the metal so you can hammer it back into shape. The process takes some time but now you're not pressured by time and can prepare accordingly. When you finish, you have your armor back in usable state. It's far from perfect as you're not a blacksmith but at least it is usable.

You place your armor on the table. Then you put one of the gems at the collar of it, letting it rest there while you align the tools around the armor. As they start glowing, you sprinkle powders over the surface of your armor and the powders disolve and are absorbed into the metal. The process lasts a couple minutes before its finished. The tools stop glowing but the gem in your armor shines in dim but obvious red glow, illuminating the metal it sinked into in the process. 

You pick the armor up and don it. You can feel a tingle touching it as it is filled with protective powers.
