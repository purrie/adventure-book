title: Troll Fighting
story: You stand before the lumbering beast, its claws ready to strike. You keep your [weapon] high, more to keep it handy for strikes when opportunity presents itself rather than for defense. You're fairly certain your only option there is to avoid getting hit, even a grazing hit could prove fatal with a monster this size. You have to wage your options carefully here.
choice: Go all in, strike it down as fast as you can as time is against you here.{condition: stam}{test: aggro}
choice: Strike at the troll when opportunity arrises.{test: norm}
choice: Play this one out carefully, no point in rushing in and getting yourself killed. Strike when it's safe.{test: safe}
