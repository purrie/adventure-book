title: [dragon]
story: You move deeper into the dungeon until you find large gate at the end of the corridor. As you're about to peek into the room, you hear a grungy voice coming from inside. "There's no point in skulking about, that doesn't suit a hero" it says mockingly. "Come inside and gaze upon your doom." You decide there's no point in sneaking as you're discovered and enter the room, cautiously still as to not let yourself be ambushed. And there you see it, a massive dragon size of a barn, laying on top of a mountain of gold coins. It sizes you with its slitted predatory eyes as it lays comfortably like a cat, completely relaxed yet you're certain, if you provoke it, it will pounce you equaly fast.

"I see you've made quite a ruckus in my home, brave hero. You killed my minions and hope to kill me as well. That is a fool's task" the massive creature growls. You draw your [weapon] and ready yourself for an attack that ultimately doesn't come. "That is unacceptable, and I, [dragon], will not tolerate such actions against me. I am however, benevelent, and will allow you a chance at fulfilling your quest, toying and torturing you until you die will be a suitable compensation for what you did. And after that, I will descend upon those that sent you here, and they will pay with their lives too. Come, and have first strike, challenger!" The dragon raises from its hoard of money as coins drip down from its scales creating a deafening clamor. It bares its scaled chest forward and you can notice a hint of a grin, as if the beast believed you can't do anything against it.
