#+title: List of items that would be useful in the project

* General Ideas
** TODO support nested adventures
Currently, all adventures need to be within books folder, I want the capture process also consider any subfolder that isn't adventure for capturing.

Main benefit for this would be to allow storing multiple adventures within a git repository to have collections of stories.
* Editor
** TODO Error checker
There need to be some way to automatically check for any issues or unused elements in the pages.
** TODO Autosave
There are situations where the program may close unexpectedly. Every save operation should be committed to drive to prevent loss of work.
